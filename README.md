# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Abdualziz

I’m a **Frontend Developer** with a background in **Embedded Systems**. After years of building performance-critical applications in **C/C++**, I transitioned into **web development** to bring ideas to life on the screen — now combining logic and visuals in the browser.

🔁 From real-time systems to responsive UIs — I love solving problems at any level of the stack.
